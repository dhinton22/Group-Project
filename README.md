## Main Problems:

- The total number of Netflix subscribers is declining for the first time in a decade.
- Competitors brought compelling services to market, and the video streaming pioneer couldn't keep up.
- The problem is that Netflix has no other way to increase its revenues other than raising the monthly subscription cost, unless it makes significant changes to its business model.

## Business Model 

It charges users a monthly subscription fee, with levels based on how many concurrent streams users want their households to have access to.
