#### Description & Reason for choosing data

#### What we hope to answer with the data 

#### Provisional Machine Learning Model

With crime data, there is a significant imbalance in the data when looking at violent vs non-violent crime.  In the Washington DC Crime dataset that we are analyzing here, there are 342,868 total crimes, where 62,339 or 18% are classified as violent crime.  Since the data is both tabular and imbalanced, it is most practical to start out with a supervised machine learning model, the balanced random forest classifier.
