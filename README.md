## Overview of Project 





## Main Problems/Questions:

According to kaggle, the goal of this project is to perform ____

- The total number of Netflix subscribers is declining for the first time in a decade.
- Competitors brought compelling services to market, and the video streaming pioneer couldn't keep up.
- The problem is that Netflix has no other way to increase its revenues other than raising the monthly subscription cost, unless it makes significant changes to its business model.
- Losing employees starting april of 2022

### Business Model 

It charges users a monthly subscription fee, with levels based on how many concurrent streams users want their households to have access to.

This model has been incredibly successful for many years, but it may have limitations. Once Netflix hits market saturation—and it may be approaching that point now—its only leverage will be subscription prices. This, too, will have limitations because consumers tend to be price sensitive, especially when they have a plethora of options, as they already do in streaming.

### Danger of losing its employees

Working at Netflix has been one of the most coveted jobs in Hollywood, if not all of corporate America. The company is considered one of the most beloved brands, pays well and offers the opportunity to work with people who have changed the way we watch TV.

But a record drop in Netflix's share price, fueled by poor financial results, has shaken employee confidence in the company's long-term trajectory. It also erased the value of many employees' options.
