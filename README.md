# DC Crime in Metropolitan area

## Overview of Final Project

### Project Goal

Main goal of our project is to create a dashboard to analyse crime patterns in Washington DC from 2008 to 2017.

### Key Deliverables

Understand patterns and gain insight into crimes in the DC police system to show trends over certain period of time (we could write here:  compare before and after Financial Crisis of 2008).

### Source of data

We extracted dataset from kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/code/sureshmelvinsigera/dc-metro-crime-data-statistics/data?select=dc_crime_add_vars.csv

After extracting dataset, we will start cleaning the dataset to get a complete and well-structured dataset.

### Questions we hope to answer (Motivation/Reason/Purpose)

- Help solve and prevent crimes
- Compare different years and finding reasons of crimes
- Expand scope of analysis to include unstructured data and visualize this dataset
- Obtain key knowledge neecessary for making infirmed decisions. 

## Summary 

Transit stations are recognized as especially criminogenic areas. These stations can serve as "generators" of crime because they combine large volumes of people in certain geographic regions and times. They can also serve as "attractors" to criminals providing opportunities for crime. To reflect trends in crime, the number of crimes divided into ..... ( we could divide by areas or times like three time groups: peak hours, off-peak daytime hours and off-peak night hours). Main the DC police system includes theft, arson, assault, murder, sexual assault, robbery and burglary had a large collection of police information reports (PIRs) that were part of each PIR contains a textual description of the incident.  This description includes when and where the incident occurred, what shift, type of offense and method used.






People who live in the Washington metro area generally consider the northwest part of the metro area to be the safest.
