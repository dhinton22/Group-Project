## Database 
For this project we are going to store our data in PostgreSQL, where we can build tables and visualize the information in a structured way to facilitate future applications. 
The first steps are to investigate and clean our dataset using a Jupyter notebook. Our dataset contains 32 columns and 320,190 rows. Some columns will be dropped while others will have some updates. The ultimate goal is to find patterns on violent vs not violent crimes.
